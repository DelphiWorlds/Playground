# Playground

## Description

A collection of demos and code that I'm working on that I have chosen to make public, usually associated with the [Kastri library](https://github.com/DelphiWorlds/Kastri).

**The code presented here may or may not make it into the Kastri library, depending on the success of the code here, and how many find the code useful**

Compatible with [Embarcadero](https://wwww.embarcadero.com) [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi)

## Project configuration

The Playground demos and other projects that depend on the Kastri library have search paths that include an environment variable user override named `Kastri` (appears as `$(Kastri)` in the paths). Either create a user override with the same name which points to your copy of Kastri, or replace the values with the appropriate path.
