# Simple Camera Demo

## Purpose

To implement camera preview/recording/playback as simply as possible on at least Android and iOS.

## Feedback

Please provide feedback about this demo as per [the main ReadMe.](https://github.com/DelphiWorlds/Playground/blob/main/Readme.md)

## Description

This project may also serve as a starting point to replace current Camera support in [Kastri](https://github.com/DelphiWorlds/Kastri).

As per the purpose section, this demo contains as simple as practicable, and implementation of camera functionality, including showing a preview, recording video (and audio where permission is granted), and playback of the recorded video.

## Barcode detection on iOS

This code also has support for integrating detection of barcodes on iOS, by way of implementing an image processor that uses the native image classes, rather than converting them to Delphi bitmaps, which can be quite costly in terms of processing time.

There are examples of image processors that use MLVision Kit (in DW.BarcodeImageProcessor.iOS), and one that uses the Zxing library by Edward Spelt (in DW.ZXingImageProcessor.iOS). For the latter, converting the image to a bitmap is unavoidable, since the Zxing code works with bitmaps.

In the demo, uncomment the appropriate code in order to use the barcode image processors.

## Project Configuration

**These are details regarding configuration if using this code in your own project.**

This code is dependent on [Kastri](https://github.com/DelphiWorlds/Kastri), so the project search paths will need to refer to it.

If using the MLVision Kit based image processor, you will need paths to the framework, as per the `Framework search path` in the project options.

If using the Zxing based image processor, you will need to configure your project search paths to point to the Zxing folders.

## Status

* May 30th, 2023

Recording issue:

On my Android device (Pixel 3a), when pressing "Stop Recording", it causes this error (in logcat, and a message is displayed on the screen):

```
2023/05/29 21:37:00.863	E	com.embarcadero.SimpleCameraDemo	30035	30035	MediaRecorder	stop failed: -1007
```

The Pixel 3a is also unable to playback the recorded video (similar problem to the Pixel 6 Pro)

* May 29th, 2023

Playback issue:

On my Android device (Pixel 6 Pro with Android 13), the video does not play back, however the audio does play. When it plays, these lines appear in the logcat messages:

```
2023/05/29 09:58:32.201	E		1258	32216	NuPlayerDecoder	Failed to create video/avc decoder
2023/05/29 09:58:32.201	E		1258	32213	NuPlayer	received error(0x80000000) from video decoder, flushing(0), now shutting down
```

So presumably my device does not support the recorded format, which is MP4 (H264).

I'm hoping someone might have a solution for this issue.

Zxing performance:

As described above, converting native images (eg UIImage or CGImage) to Delphi bitmaps can be quite costly in terms of performance, so help is sought for improving that code.

Barcode image processors:

As per the description, the current image processors are for iOS. Contributions of image processors for Android and/or alternative implementations are welcome. Please ensure that contributions adhere to [Delphi Worlds coding standards](https://github.com/DelphiWorlds/Kastri/blob/master/CodingStandards.md).

**The code/demo was built for Delphi 11.3, however it might be able to be modified to work in earlier versions**
