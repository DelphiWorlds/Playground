# Multicast Demo

## Purpose

To broadcast UDP across devices on multiple platforms

## Description

**This project is very much WORK IN PROGRESS**. The code was last touched (aside from some last minute renaming and hints/warning fixes) nearly 3 years ago, and presently I'm unsure as to what works and what doesn't. I may or may not resume work on it later.

The project came about after much frustration in [attempting to make this project work](https://github.com/DelphiWorlds/Multicaster).

I have made this project available for now in case anyone can benefit from it, and perhaps provide feedback.

**This code is dependent on the [Kastri](https://github.com/DelphiWorlds/Kastri) repo.**

Unlike the original Multicaster project mentioned above, this project has no dependency on Indy.

## Supported Versions

The code compiles in Delphi 11.x. It may or may not work on earlier versions

## Feedback

Please provide feedback about this demo as per [the main ReadMe.](https://github.com/DelphiWorlds/Playground/blob/main/Readme.md)

## Status
