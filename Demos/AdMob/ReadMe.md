# AdMob test project

## Purpose

To display ads :-)

## Description

Advertising implementation, specifically for AdMob (at present)

## Project Configuration

### Component

**Please install the TAdMobBannerAd component first** (before even loading the demo)

The package can be found [here](https://github.com/DelphiWorlds/Playground/tree/main/Packages/D110) 

### Libraries

If creating your own project, you will need to add the [`dw-admob.jar`](https://github.com/DelphiWorlds/Playground/blob/master/Lib/dw-admob.jar) file to the Libraries node under the Android platform in Project Manager

When using Delphi 10.4.x, you will need to add other libraries and disable some default libraries, as per this screenshot:

### Android Entitlements

Ensure your project has the `AdMob Service` enabled. This adds Google Play services metadata and the Ads activity to the manifest.

### Android Permission

Ensure your project has the `Access Network State` permission in Project Options

Implemented so far (Android and iOS):

* TAdMobBannerAd:  [Banner Ad](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/banner)  - very basic testing has been performed
* TAppOpenAd: [App Open Ad](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/app-open) - basic testing
* TInterstitialAd: [Interstitial Ad](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/interstitial) - basic testing
* TRewardedAd: [Rewarded Ad](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/rewarded) - basic testing
* TRewardedInterstitialAd: [Rewarded Interstitial Ad] - basic testing
  
**NOTE: On iOS, events are not working on TAppOpenAd, TRewardedAd, TRewardedInterstitialAd, TInterstitialAd**

I'm hoping someone can explain why they are not :-)

A [package has been created for Delphi 10.4.x](https://github.com/DelphiWorlds/Playground/tree/main/Packages/D104), as well as a [demo](https://github.com/DelphiWorlds/Playground/tree/main/Demos/AdMob/D104). Only RewardedAd has had very basic testing. **It is possible that something else might be broken, as some jars needed to be disabled.**
